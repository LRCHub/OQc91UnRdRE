[00:26.50] Backstreets, gotta move lowkey cah one wrong move and I might get done
[00:30.39] Before I thought about goin' in jewellers, stupid, I thought about buyin' a gun
[00:33.36] Got one on my left and she brown like Henny
[00:35.58] The one on my right is white like Rum
[00:37.27] I'm tellin' my bro don't quit
[00:38.22] Put in the work and your time will come
[00:57.72] 
[00:39.42] They're lying on us
[00:41.47] We ain't from the road, apparently we ain't on none
[00:43.16] Can't style on us, I don't need no Rollie, I'm still gon' bust
[00:46.54] My old man told me, "Quiet your noise, you don't gotta kick up a fuss"
[00:49.56] Trigger finger, click it and bust
[00:51.21] Dinger whip with the stiffest clutch
[01:09.21] 
[00:53.06] Bando, kway, no reception, bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
[00:56.88] We don't ever go to no restaurants, cinema date, she don't know that tension
[00:59.76] I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
[01:01.65] Gimme that real deepthroat, no Lemsip, huh

[01:20.81] Wadz went half on my studio time
[01:22.66] Them times, all I had was a ten sheet
[01:24.05] They showed me love when my belly was empty
[01:26.06] Bare red eye, now they jelly, they envy
[01:28.12] Envy, pree my Givenchy, they didn't think that I had it in me
[01:58.62] 
[01:29.55] Harry wan' pin up in Nero, I gave him a chunk of the dark, no Philly
[01:32.23] Just left, she sent me a text
[01:34.02] She miss me already, babe, don't be silly
[01:35.94] My baby think that she know everything so I don't need Siri
[01:38.20] As a pitney I didn't watch Disney channel
[01:41.10] My telly didn't have that many
[01:43.71] Some days, dinner, Nutella and bread, nowadays, it's tagliatelle

[02:15.50] Couldn't disguise this ting in his slim fits
[02:16.76] Big ZK on his waist, now he's limping
[02:18.24] Stay with my darg, my darg like Tintin
[02:20.30] Come off of hard cocaine, not pimping
[02:21.99] Bad B nearly had man simping
[02:23.44] Lost my mind like what was I thinking?
[02:24.30] Way too wet, nearly had man sinking
[02:41.80] 
[02:26.56] Came home, OT, I was stinking
[02:27.99] After my shower, I'm back in a dusty trap
[02:29.77] Felt sorry for boss when I bumped that cab
[02:30.89] But I got no choice, I'm sorry, my bad
[02:32.94] One day I'll pay mumzy back for the times that I had my fam goin' mad
[02:36.10] Tell the council that we don't need that flat
