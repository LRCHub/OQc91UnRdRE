[00:03.93] Ready?
[00:04.57] Ready.
[00:24.56] Nervous tension.
[00:38.05] Nervous tension.
[00:50.63] Is an unseen enemy of the human mind.
[00:53.95] Nervous tension can cause you to lack confidence in yourself,
[00:59.34] To lose your powers of concentration and to be inefficient in your work.
[01:04.70] Nervous tension can prevent you from relaxing, can spoil your leisure hours,
[01:11.56] And rob you of the sleep you need at night.
[01:14.58] Nervous tension.
[01:22.91] Nervous tension.
[01:41.98] The purpose of this record is to train you in the art of relaxing
[01:46.05] Both your mind and your body.
[01:49.81] Use it regularly.
[01:52.73] Train your mind through repetition, to follow the suggestions.
[01:57.11] Then you'll be ready to progress to side 2.
[02:18.61] 
[02:02.97] The mind remains tense when it is restlessly turning over personal problems,
[02:44.69] Worrying about financial matters, or the conflicts of daytime employment, or
[02:49.09] Fretting over the troubles of the world.
[03:09.09] 
[02:52.69] A mind so strained and tense cannot relax, even in sleep.
[02:56.92] Night passes in uneasy dreams, the body is not refreshed as it should be.
[03:03.13] But you can overcome this difficulty if you thoroughly relax your mind
[03:08.38] Before you go to bed (?).
[03:13.15] Better still you can learn to relax from time to time during the day, so
[03:18.54] That nervous tension never builds up to an unpleasant degree.
[03:49.04] 
[03:26.10] Nervous tension.
[03:39.89] Nervous tension.
[03:47.89] 
[03:53.82] You will carefully plan your course through life.
[03:59.58] You will think about your plans often.
[04:03.95] Think about it with interest.
[04:07.22] Think with pleasure of the satisfaction you'll feel as the plan becomes reality.
[04:14.91] You will firmly imprint in your mind this phrase:
[04:17.82] 'I maintain at all times a calm, confident, cheerful state of mind.'
[04:24.89] You will repeat it aloud to yourself at least 3 times daily.
[04:54.89] 
[05:02.57] You will give your mind and body the rest they need to restore energy.
[05:09.55] Very shortly you will no longer need to listen to my advice.
[05:18.04] You will absorb and understand the suggestions I have given you, and you will
[05:24.11] Learn to give them to yourself.
[05:39.61] 
[05:29.55] Nervous tension.
[06:17.50] Nervous tension.
[06:26.58] And now we shall begin.
