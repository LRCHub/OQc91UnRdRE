You've got a set of starry eyes
A pair that could make me realize
I wanna be with you all the time
Instead of lonely every night

What's with the sad look on your face
Your smile looks a little out of place
A pain that I wish I could erase
If only you'd leave me some space

Don't give me love you've left behind
Cause I am your bright star in the sky
And I will be up there waiting patiently for you

If I could make you into more
I wouldn't know wheather the reasons for
You're just a little paranoid
Every time I walk through the door
Don't tell me you're scared, that's a lie
I know how you really feel inside
So I will be outside waiting for you one more time.

It's getting hard to breathe
My body's turning blue, why can't you see?
You are the one I need
So why are you the one that's making me bleed
How long is this tension going to last
I need some sort of refreshment
How long is this tension going to last

Don't give me love you've left behind
Cause I am your bright star in the sky
And I will be up there waiting patiently for you

Don't you have an opinion
I thought you had a mind of your own
I can't believe that you're angry
You won't even talk to me on the phone
This fever is starting to hurt me
How long is this tension going to last
I need some sort of refreshment
How long is this tension going to last?
