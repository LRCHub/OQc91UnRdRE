(Rah, it's Bkay unah)
Back streets,
gotta move lowkey
Cah one wrong move
and I might get done
Before I thought
'bout going A Jewellers
Stupid,
I thought 'bout buying a gun
Got one on my left
and she brown like Henny
The one on my right is white
like rum
I'm telling my bro don't quit
Put in the work
and your time will come
They're lying on us
We ain't from the road,
apparently
and we ain't on none
Cyan't style on us
I don't need no Roley,
I'm still gon' buss
My old man told me,
"Quiet your noise
You don't gotta kick up a fuss"
Trigger finger,
click it and buss
Dinger whip
with the stiffest clutch
Bando kway, no reception
Bad B stressed,
I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to
no restaurants
Cinema date,
she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end,
no lengthen
Give me that real deep throat,
no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash new plate
Cah the dots too vintage?
Bando kway, no reception
Bad B stressed,
I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to
no restaurants
Cinema date,
she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end,
no lengthen
Give me that real deep throat,

Tempted, tempted

Wadz went half
on my studio time
Them times all
I had was a ten sheet
They showed me love
when my belly was empty
Bare red eye, now they jelly,
they envy
Envy, pree my Givenchy
They didn't think
that I had it in me
Harry wan' pin-up Pinero
I gave him a chunk of the dark,
no filly
Just left, she sent me a text
She miss me already,
bae, don't be silly
My baby think
that she know everything
So I don't need Siri
As a pickney,
I didn't watch Disney
Channel,
my telly didn't have that many
Somedays dinner
Nutella and bread
Nowadays it's the Tagliatelle
Bando kway, no reception
Bad B stressed,
I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to

Bro had to fling on a tracky
Couldn't disguise this ting
in his slim fits
Big ZK on waist,
now he's limping
Stay with my darg,
my darg like Tin Tin
Come up off hard cocaine
not pimping
Bad B nearly had man simping
Lost my mind like
what was I thinking?
Way too wet,
nearly had man sinking
Came home, OT,
I was stinking
After my shower,
I'm back in a dusty trap
Felt sorry for boss
when I bumped that cab
But I got no choice,
I'm sorry, my bad
One day I'll pay mumsie back
For the times
that I had my fam going mad
Tell the council
that we don't need that flat
They can take that back
Got the brand new gaff
Bando kway, no reception
Bad B stressed,
I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to
